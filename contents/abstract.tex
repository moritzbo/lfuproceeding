    In this proceeding a review of a simultaneous analysis of the 
    $B^+ \to K^+ l^+ l^-$ and $B^0 \to K^{\star 0} l^+ l^-$ decays to test muon-electron universality
    is presented. Using a dataset of B-meson decays collected with the LHCb detector from Run 1 and 2 with
    ${\SI{9}{\femto\barn}}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity, multivariate selections and strict particle identification requirements were applied to enhance signal purity 
    and statistical sensitivity. Backgrounds from misidentified hadronic decays were studied and included in the analysis. 
    The measurements establish results for the specific non-resonant $q^2$ range and are in good agreement to the Standard Model, yielding a notable improvement over 
    previous measurements. %Notably, the results align with the predictions of the Standard Model.
